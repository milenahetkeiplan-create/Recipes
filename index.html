                Welcome to my website about my favourite recipes. With this website I want to demonstrate my capabillities with HTML and later on CSS.
                At the beginning, this site will not look very good, but I will come back to work on this later on. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> that I did not create these recipes, sometimes I might have added something to the recipe. <em>You will find a link at the bottom of the recipe to the original site.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish you a lot of fun recreating these recipes. 
            </p>
